    title: Confirm shortcut mapping and interaction boundaries
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Phase decisions and boundaries are fully captured in phase.md (modifier per platform, 20-key mapping, editable-focus guard, toolbox-only scope)."
    touched: []

  - id: S002
    title: Add a small hotkey-mapping module (pure functions)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Added a renderer helper module for tool-index↔hotkey mapping, platform label formatting, keyboard event parsing via event.code, and editable-element detection."
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/tools/mapEditorToolHotkeys.ts

  - id: S003
    title: Track modifier-held state for showing the overlay
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "MapEditorDockPanel now tracks whether the primary modifier is held via window keydown/keyup and clears on blur to avoid stuck overlay state."
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/panels/MapEditorDockPanel.tsx

  - id: S004
    title: Render pill badges over Toolbox tool buttons
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Toolbox buttons now render a small non-interactive pill badge with the platform-idiomatic shortcut label while the primary modifier is held (only for tool indices < 20)."
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/panels/MapEditorDockPanel.tsx

  - id: S005
    title: Implement keydown activation for tool selection
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "MapEditorDockPanel listens for tool hotkeys (Cmd/Ctrl + digit, Shift for the second bank), ignores events while typing in editable elements, and activates the corresponding tool from MAP_EDITOR_TOOLS." 
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/panels/MapEditorDockPanel.tsx

  - id: S006
    title: Verify mapping stays automatic as tools change
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Shortcut labels and activation are derived from MAP_EDITOR_TOOLS iteration order and constrained to indices 0–19; tools beyond 20 have no badge and no number shortcut." 
    touched: []

  - id: S007
    title: Unit tests for the hotkey mapping/parsing helpers (L04)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Added Jest unit tests covering index→descriptor mapping, label formatting, event.code parsing across platforms (including shift bank and numpad option), and editable-element guards." 
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/tools/mapEditorToolHotkeys.test.ts

  - id: S008
    title: Update docs (L09)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Documented toolbox hotkeys (20 max), mapping rules, modifier-held badge overlay, and platform differences in renderer UI subsystem docs." 
    touched:

  - id: S009
    title: Quality gates
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "User-confirmed: npm run lint passes (with a TS-eslint supported-version warning) and npm run typecheck passes; Jest is green."
