    title: Record current map geometry invariants (repo truth)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Confirmed sector-id semantics and portal predicate: renderer decode maps walls[].front_sector/back_sector directly to MapWall.frontSector/backSector (no index remap) in src/renderer/ui/editor/map/mapDecoder.ts and src/renderer/ui/editor/map/mapViewModel.ts, so walls reference sector ids in-editor. Portal-ness is consistently wall.backSector > -1 (MapEditorCanvas Door tool canPlaceDoorAtWallIndex and portal overlay). Wall order must remain stable because doors bind by wall array index (MapDoor.wallIndex) and MapCommandEngine create-door uses wall_index; therefore create-room must never reorder walls and must preserve existing indices when splitting (append new segments)."

    title: Define the room placement contract + defaults
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Defined shared, deterministic create-room contract in src/shared/domain/mapRoomCreation.ts: CreateRoomRequest (template, center, size, rotationQuarterTurns, defaults, placement plan) plus constants (snapThresholdPx=12, rotation step, scale step, min size). Texture defaults are passed explicitly as strings (renderer-selected from AssetIndex) to keep main command deterministic and game-agnostic."

    title: Implement pure geometry helpers for preview + validation (domain)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Added deterministic, pure geometry helpers in src/shared/domain/mapRoomGeometry.ts: template polygon generation (rectangle/square/triangle), 90° rotation, edge extraction, segment intersection, point-in-sector containment and enclosing-sector selection, nearest-wall snapping (px threshold), adjacent portal planning (axis-aligned collinearity + snap translation + overlap interval), and a structured validity result (nested vs adjacent vs invalid with reason). Updated adjacent validity to evaluate intersection after snapping (on the snapped polygon, ignoring the target wall) so ineligible nearby walls (diagonals/portals) don’t incorrectly invalidate placements. Triangle template base is on +Y by default so triangles can attach to horizontal walls without requiring rotation. Unit tests updated/extended in src/shared/domain/mapRoomGeometry.test.ts; suite passes."

Updated adjacent validation to allow harmless endpoint-touch intersections and added vertex/endpoint reuse to prevent degenerate split segments. Verified via Jest coverage on create-room scenarios."

Shared placement validity now returns room-valid/seed for empty geometry; renderer sends seed placement in that case; main MapCommandEngine accepts seed placement only when sectors/walls are empty and creates a sector with exterior walls (no portal wiring).
