    title: Record current map geometry invariants (repo truth)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Confirmed sector-id semantics and portal predicate: renderer decode maps walls[].front_sector/back_sector directly to MapWall.frontSector/backSector (no index remap) in src/renderer/ui/editor/map/mapDecoder.ts and src/renderer/ui/editor/map/mapViewModel.ts, so walls reference sector ids in-editor. Portal-ness is consistently wall.backSector > -1 (MapEditorCanvas Door tool canPlaceDoorAtWallIndex and portal overlay). Wall order must remain stable because doors bind by wall array index (MapDoor.wallIndex) and MapCommandEngine create-door uses wall_index; therefore create-room must never reorder walls and must preserve existing indices when splitting (append new segments)."

    title: Define the room placement contract + defaults
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Defined shared, deterministic create-room contract in src/shared/domain/mapRoomCreation.ts: CreateRoomRequest (template, center, size, rotationQuarterTurns, defaults, placement plan) plus constants (snapThresholdPx=12, rotation step, scale step, min size). Texture defaults are passed explicitly as strings (renderer-selected from AssetIndex) to keep main command deterministic and game-agnostic."

    title: Implement pure geometry helpers for preview + validation (domain)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Added deterministic, pure geometry helpers in src/shared/domain/mapRoomGeometry.ts: template polygon generation (rectangle/square/triangle), 90° rotation, edge extraction, segment intersection, point-in-sector containment and enclosing-sector selection, nearest-wall snapping (px threshold), adjacent portal planning (axis-aligned collinearity + snap translation + overlap interval), and a structured validity result (nested vs adjacent vs invalid with reason). Updated adjacent validity to evaluate intersection after snapping (on the snapped polygon, ignoring the target wall) so ineligible nearby walls (diagonals/portals) don’t incorrectly invalidate placements. Triangle template base is on +Y by default so triangles can attach to horizontal walls without requiring rotation. Unit tests updated/extended in src/shared/domain/mapRoomGeometry.test.ts; suite passes."

    title: Remove final restriction on adjacent placement for squares/triangles
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Fixed findNearestEligibleWallToPolygonWithinThresholdPx to use distanceSegmentToSegment for finding nearest eligible walls, filtering for solid axis-aligned walls. This resolves the restriction where adjacent placement failed for squares/triangles when their edge was longer than the target wall. Confirmed with passing tests in mapRoomGeometry.test.ts. No TypeScript errors."

    title: Extend shared IPC types with map-edit/create-room
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Extended shared IPC typing to include the new atomic command kind 'map-edit/create-room' carrying CreateRoomRequest (src/shared/ipc/nomosIpc.ts). Added create-room-specific MapEditError codes in src/shared/domain/results.ts. Updated exhaustiveness across command unions; behavior is implemented in S005. Typecheck and Jest suite pass."

    title: Implement map-edit/create-room in MapCommandEngine
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Implemented 'map-edit/create-room' in MapCommandEngine with strict request/json validation, nested vs adjacent placement handling, intersection rejection, deterministic sector id allocation (max+1), portal wiring via wall splitting without reordering existing walls, and selection set to the new sector. Updated adjacent validation to allow harmless endpoint-touch intersections and added vertex/endpoint reuse to prevent degenerate split segments. Verified via Jest coverage on create-room scenarios."

    notes: "Added MapCommandEngine create-room unit tests covering nested + adjacent success paths and major failure modes (invalid JSON, invalid size, adjacent-too-far, intersects-walls, non-collinear). Added regression coverage for continuing room creation after a full-wall portal join, and relaxed a brittle wall-count assertion to avoid depending on whether portal endpoints coincide with existing vertices. Confirmed MapCommandEngine.test.ts passes."

    title: Implement Room tool preview rendering + click behavior
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Implemented Room tool interaction in MapEditorCanvas: mouse move computes a template polygon under cursor, validates via shared pure geometry helpers (nested vs adjacent with 12px snap threshold), renders a red/green outline, and sets cursor to not-allowed/crosshair. Clicking when valid issues window.nomos.map.edit with map-edit/create-room (renderer supplies deterministic texture defaults from AssetIndex as texture filenames/basenames) and applies the returned selection effect; stale revisions refresh the snapshot without auto-retry."

Shortcuts ignore key events when typing in inputs and call preventDefault/stopPropagation when handled."

    notes: "Quality gates (post-fix): npm test (35/35 suites, 378 tests passed), npm run typecheck (pass), npm run lint (pass; emits TypeScript version support warning from @typescript-eslint). Manual verification to re-check: adjacent placement becomes valid within 12px snap threshold (green preview) and creates a portal; Rectangle defaults to a long/thin hall distinct from Square; undo/redo works."

    title: Bugfix: adjacent placement for square and triangle rooms
    implemented: true

    notes: "Generalized edge selection and collinearity logic in computeAdjacentPortalPlan to support adjacent placement for square and triangle rooms.

    title: Allow seed room creation in an empty map
    implemented: true

    notes: "Added seed room placement mode (room-placement/seed) for creating the first room on an empty map (no sectors/walls). Shared placement validity now returns room-valid/seed for empty geometry; renderer sends seed placement in that case; main MapCommandEngine accepts seed placement only when sectors/walls are empty and creates a sector with exterior walls (no portal wiring). Added unit tests for domain validity and engine success/rejection, and updated docs describing the exception."
