    title: Locate and characterize current picking behavior
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Current Select click path: MapEditorCanvas onMouseDown (select mode) -> hitTestSelection(authoredWorldPoint, view, decodedMap). hitTestSelection prioritizes markers > doors > walls (distance-to-centerline threshold = 10px in screen-space) > sector (ray-crossing). Repro for reported bug: in textured mode, rendered wall strip thickness is TEXTURED_WALL_THICKNESS_WORLD=0.4 world units; at high zoom (e.g., view.scale=64), strip is 25.6px thick so clicks inside strip near its edge are ~12.8px from centerline and can miss the 10px wall threshold, falling through to sector selection."

    title: Define picking policy (rules and tie-breakers)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Documented explicit picking priority order, screen-space thresholds, textured wall polygon inclusion rule, and tie-breakers in phase.md under 'Picking policy'."

    title: Extract picking into a pure, testable module
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Added pure renderer picking module (pickMapSelection) and replaced MapEditorCanvas in-file hitTestSelection with the extracted function. Hoisted textured wall polygons into a memo for reuse."

    title: Improve wall picking robustness
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Improved textured-mode wall picking by selecting a wall when the pointer is inside its rendered strip polygon (prevents falling through to sector when strip is thicker than the centerline hit threshold at high zoom)."

    title: Add regression-focused unit tests for picking
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Added mapPicking.test.ts covering priority order (marker/door/wall/sector), closest-wall tie-break, and textured wall strip regression where polygon inclusion must select the wall."

    title: Implement hover preview state in Select mode
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Added hoveredSelection state in MapEditorCanvas; updated onMouseMove (select mode) to compute hover candidate via pickMapSelection, and clears it when leaving the stage or switching tools."

    title: Render hover outline (yellow border)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Rendered hover preview outline in MapEditorCanvas using a yellow (GOLD) stroke for the hovered selection candidate, painted beneath the existing red selection outline."
    touched:

    title: Update renderer UI documentation (if needed)

    notes: "Updated renderer UI docs to mention Select-mode hover outline (yellow) and textured-mode wall strip polygon picking behavior."

    title: Verification pass and quality gates
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Quality gates pass: npm test -- --coverage=false, npm run typecheck, npm run lint. Manual verification completed on 2026-01-21: small walls near boundaries select wall (not sector), sector selection still works when clicking well inside, and hover outline matches click selection and clears off-object."

    title: Complete L04 branch coverage for pickMapSelection
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Expanded mapPicking.test.ts to cover remaining pickMapSelection conditional paths: particle hit, light hit, textured mode without polygons (centerline threshold still applies), doors with missing wall index / missing wall vertices (skip safely), and null return outside any sector. Verified mapPicking test suite passes."
    touched:

    title: Record manual UX verification for acceptance criteria
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Run the app and confirm: (1) small wall near other walls/boundaries selects wall not sector, (2) sector selection still possible when clicking well inside, (3) hover outline matches click selection and clears off-object. Record results (and any repro map/steps) in review.md."
