    title: Confirm displayed-grid snap increment rules
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Recorded explicit zoom-based grid spacing rules (integer world-unit steps, ~24px target, major every 5)."

    title: Add main-store state + mutators
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Added AppStore set/toggle APIs for snap-to-grid (default on) and unit tests covering both branches."

    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Added View → Snap to Grid checkbox item (checked via mapGridSettings) and wired toggle callback through main menu installation."

    title: Surface snap state in the renderer snapshot
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Verified existing state snapshot flow already forwards mapGridSettings (including isSnapToGridEnabled) into renderer nomosStore without new IPC."

    title: Align grid display spacing + snap spacing (renderer)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Extracted chooseMinorGridWorldSpacing into a reusable helper (discrete world-unit steps) and updated MapEditorCanvas grid rendering to use it; added unit tests."

    title: Implement reusable snapping helper (renderer)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Added pure grid snapping helpers (snap to fixed increment and to displayed grid via viewScale) with unit tests, including invalid-spacing branch coverage."

    title: Apply snapping to room creation + room clone placement
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Room tool now snaps the pointer-derived authored world point (driving roomCenter) to the displayed grid when snap is enabled, so both preview polygons and committed create-room/stamp-room use the same snapped anchor."
    touched:

  - id: S009
    title: Apply snapping to wall splitting
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Split-wall now snaps the pointer-derived world point to the displayed grid (when enabled) before projecting to the wall segment, and issues the split at the resulting point."

  - id: S010
    title: Apply snapping to entity + light placement
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Light create and entity drag/drop now snap pointer-derived world points to the displayed grid (when enabled) and use the snapped point for sector validity and command payloads."
    touched:

  - id: S011
    title: Apply snapping to move tool + player start + wall slice
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Move tool now snaps preview and committed positions when enabled; player-start pick commits snapped coordinates. Wall slicing is implemented by the existing Split tool, and its pointer-derived input point is snapped before issuing map-edit/split-wall."

    title: Tests (menu/store/renderer)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Extended View menu template tests for Snap to Grid existence/order/checked state and callback wiring. Added unit tests for grid spacing chooser + snapping helpers (snap on/off behavior covered via invalid-spacing + explicit toggles at call sites)."

    title: Shift modifier: temporarily disable snapping
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: "Added Shift override so holding Shift temporarily disables snapping even when Snap to Grid is enabled; implemented via shouldSnapToGrid helper and applied to pointer-driven placement; updated docs and added unit tests."
