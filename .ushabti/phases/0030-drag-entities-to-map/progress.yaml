steps:
  - id: S001
    title: Confirm current map entity JSON shape and selection behavior
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Confirmed renderer decoder expects entities[] entries with keys x,y, optional def (string|null), optional yaw_deg (number, default 0). Renderer selection model uses { kind: 'entity', index }. Create-entity will write def as engine-facing entity name and yaw_deg as 0 by default."

      - src/renderer/ui/editor/map/mapSelection.ts

  - id: S002
    title: Decide and document sprite resolution rules
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Defined deterministic sprite resolution: prefer exact asset index hits for Images/Sprites/<file> then Assets/Images/Sprites/<file>; otherwise fall back to lexicographically smallest asset path whose basename matches sprite.file.name. Implemented as pure helper with unit tests."
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/entities/spriteAssetResolver.ts
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/entities/spriteAssetResolver.test.ts

  - id: S003
    title: Add a new non-closable DockView panel: Entities
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Added non-closable DockView Entities panel and placed it as a tab peer to Inspector in the right-side group."
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/EditorShell.tsx
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/panels/EntitiesDockPanel.tsx

  - id: S004
    title: Define pure parsers/types for entity manifest and entity defs
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Added pure parsers for entity manifest files and entity def display fields (name, sprite.file.name, sprite.frames.dimensions) with explicit error results and branch coverage tests; extracted manifest parser for reuse in Inspector."
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/entities/entityManifestParser.ts
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/entities/entityManifestParser.test.ts

  - id: S005
    title: Implement Entities list loading flow (manifest → defs)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Entities panel now loads the entity manifest via readFileBytes with path fallbacks, reads/parses each def JSON, and renders stable list rows with resilient error states; ordering is deterministic (sorted by def name when available)."
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/panels/EntitiesDockPanel.tsx

  - id: S006
    title: Implement thumbnail rendering (first frame clip)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Added EntitySpriteThumbnail that resolves sprite assets deterministically, loads bytes via readFileBytes, clips to the first frame using an overflow-hidden wrapper, and revokes blob URLs on change/unmount (resource-safe)."
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/entities/EntitySpriteThumbnail.tsx
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/panels/EntitiesDockPanel.tsx

  - id: S007
    title: Add shared drag payload format for entity placement
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Defined shared drag payload MIME type and pure encode/decode helpers (with tests) and wired entity list rows to set the payload on drag start."
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/entities/entityPlacementDragPayload.ts
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/entities/entityPlacementDragPayload.test.ts
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/panels/EntitiesDockPanel.tsx

  - id: S008
    title: Add a new atomic command: map-edit/create-entity
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Extended MapEditAtomicCommand IPC union with map-edit/create-entity { at:{x,y}, def, yawDeg? } to support atomic undoable placement." 
    touched:
      - src/shared/ipc/nomosIpc.ts

  - id: S009
    title: Implement map-edit/create-entity in MapCommandEngine
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Implemented create-entity atomic command: validates inputs and map JSON entities array, appends {x,y,def,yaw_deg}, and returns selection effect to the new entity index."
    touched:
      - src/main/application/maps/MapCommandEngine.ts

  - id: S010
    title: Add unit tests for map-edit/create-entity conditional paths
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Added Jest coverage for create-entity success paths and invalid input/json branches; suite passes."
    touched:
      - src/main/application/maps/MapCommandEngine.test.ts

  - id: S011
    title: Implement drop target behavior on the map canvas
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Map canvas now accepts entity drag payloads, shows valid/invalid cursor based on sector containment, blocks drops outside sectors, converts client coords to authored world coords using current pan/zoom/origin, and issues map-edit/create-entity on valid drop." 
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/MapEditorCanvas.tsx
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/map/mapPicking.ts

  - id: S012
    title: Asset refresh wiring for Entities list
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Entities panel reload effect keys off assetIndex.builtAtIso (asset refresh) and uses a monotonically increasing loadId to cancel stale async loads."
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/panels/EntitiesDockPanel.tsx

  - id: S013
    title: Update subsystem documentation (L09)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Updated renderer UI and map edit command docs to include Entities panel, drag/drop sector-only placement behavior, and the map-edit/create-entity command contract."

  - id: S014
    title: Manual smoke + verification gates
    implemented: false
    reviewed: false
    notes: "Automated gates run and green: jest, typecheck, lint. Manual smoke (Entities list load, drag to sector, blocked drop outside sector, undo/redo, asset refresh) still required before marking complete."
    touched:
      - src/renderer/ui/editor/MapEditorCanvas.tsx
