    title: Confirm current behavior and collect repro cases
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: |-
      Repo contained no existing map JSON fixtures, so added 3 minimal renderer-decodable repro maps under docs/repro-maps:
      - 0016-rectangle-room.json (convex right-angle corners)
      - 0016-concave-room.json (concave corner)
      - 0016-acute-corner.json (very acute corner to exercise miter-limit)

      Current textured-wall algorithm (src/renderer/ui/editor/MapEditorCanvas.tsx):
      - For each wall segment, compute midpoint + angle.
      - Draw a rotated rectangle of length == segment length and thickness == texturedWallThicknessPx/view.scale.
      - Rectangle is centered on the wall centerline and has square end-caps.
      Failure modes:
      - Adjacent wall rectangles overlap at joints (double-thickness blobs / texture overlap).
      - Square end-caps do not produce clean joins at corners (visible cut-outs / mismatched corners on angled joins).

    title: Define the join model and invariants
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: |-
      Join model (textured walls) definition:
      - Adjacency discovery: compute join geometry only within an ordered sector boundary loop built from walls where wall.frontSector == sector.id.
        - Each boundary is treated as a closed polyline in that order.
        - If a sector loop cannot be constructed, or if an edge cannot be mapped to a wall, that sector’s walls fall back to simple capped strips.

      - Per-vertex join behavior (for consecutive edges in a loop):
        - Default: miter join computed via intersection of the two offset lines (left and right sides computed independently).
        - Near-collinear tolerance: treat edges as collinear when |cross(dirPrev, dirNext)| < 1e-6.
          - In this case, use the average normal (normalize(nPrev + nNext)) for a stable join point.
        - Miter limit: if the computed miter distance from the shared vertex exceeds miterLimit * halfThickness, engage bevel fallback.
          - miterLimit = 4.0.
          - Fallback strategy: use a bounded join point along the bisector of the two normals (normalize(nPrev + nNext)) scaled to (miterLimit * halfThickness).
          - This is chosen to prevent unbounded spikes while keeping a single shared join point so adjacent wall strips still meet without overlap.

      - Degenerate edges:
        - Zero-length walls (|p1 - p0| <= 1e-4) are skipped (no polygon emitted).

      - Non-manifold vertices:
        - If connectivity is ambiguous (not exactly two consecutive boundary edges at a vertex within a loop), do not attempt join-aware geometry.
          Emit per-wall capped strips for affected walls to avoid crashes and keep deterministic rendering.

    title: Extract pure geometry helpers for wall strip construction
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: |-
      Added a renderer-local, pure TypeScript geometry module for computing join-aware textured wall strip polygons.
      The module:
      - Accepts a decoded MapViewModel + thicknessWorld
      - Computes per-wall polygons via ordered sector boundary loops (frontSector walls)
      - Provides safe fallbacks (capped strips) for walls not in a computable loop
      - Has no Konva/DOM dependencies

    title: Unit tests for the geometry helpers
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: |-
      Added Jest unit tests for computeTexturedWallStripPolygons covering:
      - square loop shared join points
      - concave join stability
      - near-collinear stability
      - degenerate zero-length wall skipping
      - miter-limit clamp behavior
      - non-positive thickness handling
      - capped-strip fallback quad shape

    title: Integrate join-aware geometry into textured wall rendering
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: |-
      Updated textured wall rendering in MapEditorCanvas to use computeTexturedWallStripPolygons.
      Rendering now draws join-aware per-wall polygons (instead of centered rectangles) while preserving:
      - texture tiling (CanvasPattern transform)
      - 1px-ish outline stroke compensation (1/view.scale)
      - missing-texture fallback to wireframe segment
      Texture orientation is preserved by drawing polygons in wall-local space under a per-wall Konva rotation.

    title: Prevent inter-sector overlap (one-sided wall rendering)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: |-
      Updated textured wall strip geometry to be one-sided (centerline + inward offset) per sector boundary loop,
      so adjacent sectors sharing a boundary render their strips offset into their own interiors rather than overlapping.
      Implementation details:
      - Determine sector loop winding via signed polygon area; choose inward normal accordingly.
      - Compute join points only for the offset edge (miter join with miter limit), keeping the centerline edge on the wall segment.
      - Preserve safe fallback to capped strips when a loop cannot be built or join data is missing.
      Updated unit test expectations for miter-limit bounds to match one-sided thickness.
      Verified: wallStripGeometry tests, typecheck, and lint pass.

    title: Tests: one-sided interior offset invariants
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: |-
      Added unit tests covering the previously-uncovered one-sided strip branches/invariants:
      - CW sector loop winding (area < 0) flips inward offset to the right side of directed edges.
      - Adjacent sectors sharing a boundary via duplicated walls offset into opposite interiors (no overlap area).
      Added an optional adjacent-sector repro map fixture for manual verification.

    title: Validate selection/hit-testing ergonomics remain correct
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: |-
      Verified by inspection that selection/hit-testing remains segment-based:
      - hitTestSelection computes wall distance-to-segment from the wall centerline (unchanged).
      - door hit-testing and door marker placement are still computed from the referenced wall segment midpoint (unchanged).
      The new join-aware textured wall polygons affect only rendering, not selection logic.

    title: Handle malformed topology safely
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: |-
      Hardened wall strip computation against malformed topology:
      - Sector loop geometry now requires at least 3 collected edges.
      - If loop-to-wall mapping produces non-contiguous segments (broken adjacency), join-aware geometry is skipped for that sector.
      - Rendering falls back to per-wall capped strips (simple quads) rather than producing unstable join math.
      This ensures missing vertices / missing edges / broken loops degrade gracefully.

    title: Update subsystem documentation (L09)
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: |-
      Updated renderer UI subsystem documentation to describe join-aware textured wall geometry,
      the miter-limit behavior, one-sided (sector-interior) strips to prevent inter-sector overlap,
      and the malformed-topology fallback to capped strips.

      Quality gates PASS:
      - npm test
      - npm run typecheck
      - npm run lint

      Note: lint initially failed due to an unused helper in wallStripGeometry.ts; removed it and reran lint successfully.

    title: Manual verification pass
    implemented: true
    reviewed: true
    notes: |-
      User verified at runtime that textured-mode rendering looks correct.
      Manual verification checklist completed:
      - Corners meet cleanly (no visible gaps).
      - No odd overlap artifacts.
      - One-sided interior strip rendering prevents inter-sector overlap.
      - Zoom maintains thickness/tiling behavior.
